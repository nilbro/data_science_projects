    "# Data Modelling\n",
    "### Data modeling (data modelling) is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a Database. This data model is a conceptual representation of Data objects, the associations between different data objects and the rules. Data modeling helps in the visual representation of data and enforces business rules, regulatory compliances, and government policies on the data. Data Models ensure consistency in naming conventions, default values, semantics, security while ensuring quality of the data. "
