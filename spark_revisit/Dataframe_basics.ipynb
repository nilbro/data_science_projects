    "#### In Apache Spark, a DataFrame is a distributed collection of rows under named columns. In simple terms, it is same as a table in relational database or an Excel sheet with Column headers. It also shares some common characteristics with RDD:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Immutable in nature : We can create DataFrame / RDD once but canâ€™t change it. And we can transform a DataFrame / RDD  after applying transformations.\n",
    "2. Lazy Evaluations: Which means that a task is not executed until an action is performed.\n",
    "3. Distributed: RDD and DataFrame both are distributed in nature.\n"

    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DataFrames are designed for processing large collection of structured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "2. Observations in Spark DataFrame are organised under named columns, which helps Apache Spark to understand the schema of a DataFrame. This helps Spark optimize execution plan on these queries.\n",
    "3. DataFrame in Apache Spark has the ability to handle petabytes of data.\n",
    "4. DataFrame has a support for wide range of data format and sources.\n",
    "5. It has API support for different languages like Python, R, Scala, Java.\n"
